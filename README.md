## Contributing
Any contributions are highly appreciated. When you want to create a new documentation page you will need to follow some guidelines.
- Every file/folder should start of with a number that represents the order
- If you want to split a title into multiple words use underscores
- The maximum depth for folders is 1
- Every file should be Markdown

An example for a new file could be `93_Example_title.md`.
